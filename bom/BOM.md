### Mounting Hardware/Stanoffs

* 4x 11mm F/F for pi 
* 2x 16mm F/F - bottom side 
* 3x 5mm M/F - top side

Top side spacing will depend on your switch choice.  

Knobs are up to you.

## Key switches: 

The PCB is configured to use either Cherry MX or Kailh Choc (V1) switches. If you use Choc's you may want to use the spacer PCB to raise the height of the installed switch.

### Kailh Choc

Kailh Low Profile Choc Switches

### MX 

Any of the Cherry MX (or MX footprint) switches will work. Red/SilentRed/Blue/Brown/Black/SpeedSilver.  
Red is linear (45g). Blue is clicky & tactile (50g). Brown is tactile (45g). Black is similar to Red but 60g actuation force. SpeedSilver (shorter key travel for gamers) are linear and __Expensive__( 45g)

## Keycaps: 

NOTE - Chocs have specific keycaps and are not compatible with MX switches.

#### Chocs keycaps

MBK profile caps are great:  
See https://mkultra.click/search.php?search_query=mbk&section=product


#### MX keycaps

Any MX-compatible keycaps will work, but DSA profile caps work well for this application.

[DSA "Dolch" Keyset (Two Shot) "Windowed" Keys](https://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-dolch-keyset-two-shot/) (choose the __LED Kit__ option).  

[Flashquark Translucent DSA Keycaps](https://flashquark.com/product/translucent-dsa-keycaps/) (in Black, White, Clear, Blue, Red) - __50 per pack__. ($12.99-$15.99 per pack)

[Blue Hat 1U DSA Blank Printed Keycaps PBT Keycaps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SJKMNWC) (Gray Translucent) - __37 per pack__. ($15.55 per pack and prime shipping)  
(about the same as the black ones from Flashquark above)

[Maxkeyboard Black Translucent MX Blank](https://www.maxkeyboard.com/black-translucent-cherry-mx-blank-keycap-set-for-esc-w-a-s-d-or-e-s-d-f-and-arrow-keys.html) (pack of 9).
